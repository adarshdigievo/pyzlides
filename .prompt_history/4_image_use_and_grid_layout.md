## Prompt

make the aspect ratio 16:9 - 16 is the length and 9 is the height.

also use the images added in examples/images folder. utilize it as actual slide background or to include it inside
slides.

add a grid layout option inside slides - we can split slide horizontally into 2 or 3 grid layout and add elelements
inside each. impmement necessary functionality for that and add a new example to illustrate it.

note that the example slide pdf should be generated inside their respective example folders only. do not generate pdf in
the project root. this is true for config files also. make the config, pdf generation work inside the respective example
folders. generate and inspect pdfs for all the example folders - for various example slide implmenetations.

since the lib is now installed using pip install -e . , you can use it as a module. so correct your usages - do not
change file structure of examples

## Junie Response

A 16:9 aspect ratio and grid layout functionality were successfully implemented for slide generation, with all examples
tested and PDFs generated in their respective folders. No errors were encountered during the process.
