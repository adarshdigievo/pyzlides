## Junie Response

The entire functionality of the Pyzlides library was successfully implemented based on the specifications in the
readme.md, including the creation of core slide elements, layout classes, and a PDF generator. The `generate_pdf`
command executed without errors, resulting in a valid presentation.pdf file. All components are now operational,
fulfilling the project requirements.
