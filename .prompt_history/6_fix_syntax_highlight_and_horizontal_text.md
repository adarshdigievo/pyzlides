## Prompt

- syntax highlight is not working.

- when there is too much text, split it into multiple slides automatically. currently the contents are being cut out -
  for exmaple in the text and code example.

- also the newline feature is not working as expected. since title texts are starting from centre of the page, some text
  is still getting cut out horizontally - relook the calculation part

## Junie Response

Syntax highlighting was implemented, automatic slide splitting was added, and text positioning issues for centered
titles were resolved. All changes were tested successfully across multiple examples.
