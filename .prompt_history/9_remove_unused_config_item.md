## Prompt

i can see that the layouts section in config is unused. remove this from example config files and Config class defined
in core.py

## Junie Response

The `layouts` section was removed from the Config class in core.py and from all example config files, confirming it was
unused. Functionality was verified by successfully generating presentations from both the basic-presentation and
grid-layout examples without any errors.
