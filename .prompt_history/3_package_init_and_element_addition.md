## Task

instead of polluting the root dir structure, you can install the package locally as pip install -e . and then run it
inside examples.

---

create multiple elements to support:

title slide - just a title in the centre - horizontally and vertically

image backgrounds - support images as slide backgrounds.

fix text getting cut out to the next sections.

add H1 to h3 tags - different type of sections.

in the example presentation, add slides to illustrate various types - title only, title with text, title with image,
title with image and text, dark mode presentation, white mode presentation, custom background image presentation.

make folders inside example folder for each example. add more elements to the definition as needed - to support a fully
featured slides functionality.

also, inline text colours can be specified to text elements.

## Response

The task enhanced a Python library for generating presentation slides with features like title slides and image
backgrounds. The outcome was successful, but an error occurred indicating invalid slide objects in the generated PDF.
The library is now installable and usable, requiring further debugging for the slide object issue.
