## Junie Response

The text centering issue in title slides was resolved, ensuring no text is cut off on the left side. Additionally, the
code component now preserves original spacing and indentation, successfully generating PDFs with the expected number of
slides across various examples. All requirements from the issue description have been implemented and tested
successfully.
