## Prompt

1. detect when texts flow out of the view - and then fix it to go to next line. regenerate all examples after this
   change. also test this with long headings, text, etc. there should be a bit of default margins on top botoom left and
   right.

2. also, add a code component - that accept a code in markdown block and provide syntax highlighted output in text. you
   can use the already installed pygments library for the same.

## Junie Response

Text overflow detection was implemented to ensure that long texts wrap to the next line with default margins.
Additionally, a new Code component was added to accept markdown code blocks and provide syntax-highlighted output using
the pygments library. All changes were successfully tested, and existing examples were regenerated to confirm
functionality.
