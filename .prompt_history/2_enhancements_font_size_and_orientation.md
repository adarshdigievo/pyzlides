## Prompt

the pages are made in portrait mode - change it to landscape mode.

also, bolding does not seem to work.

increase the text size - it is a presentation, not just a simple pdf file.

also make necessary changes so that this can be published as a library.

people can install this library and then add config and slide files and use the lib to generate pdf. sample slide files
and conifg can be moved to examples folder if needed. keep the library source directory clean

## Junie Response

The project was updated to generate PDFs in landscape mode, with fixed bolding and increased text sizes. The library
structure was reorganized for publication, and all functionalities were tested successfully.
